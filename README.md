# Probabilitic Graphical Model Notes

I'm trying to compile my pgm notes into a LaTeX document like I did for my [Machine Learning Notes](https://github.com/ccorcos/machine-learning-notes). This is still very much a work in progress.

## To Do

  - log-linear models
    - ising models
  - conditional random fields (CRF)
  - plate and template models
  - information matrix representation markov networks (MN)
  - covariance matrix representation of bayesian networks (BN)
  - exponential family
    - optimility derivation introducing KL divergence
    - conjugate prior
  - variable elimination
    - sum-product
    - tree width
    - hidden markov model
  - junction tree
    - message passing
    - belief update
    -loopy belief propagation
  - maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
    - for bayesian networks
    - for markov netowrk
    - for conditional random fields
  - maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation
    - for bayesian networks
    - for markov netowrk
    - for conditional random fields
  - EM algorithm for incomplete data
  - Mean Field Approximateion and Variational method
  - Structure LEarning
